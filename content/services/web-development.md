title: "Web Development"
weight: 10
icon: "code"
description: "Fast, accessible, maintainable websites built on static site generators or your existing CMS, with performance budgets enforced in CI."
eyebrow: "Service"
lead: "Marketing sites and content platforms that load in under a second on a mid-range phone and that your team can edit without calling us."
summary: "Marketing sites and content platforms that load fast, rank well and stay editable by your own team."
highlights:
  - "Core Web Vitals budgets enforced in CI"
  - "WCAG 2.2 AA as a contract term"
  - "Editor training and written handover"
engagement: "Fixed-price project after a discovery sprint, or a retained allocation for continuous work."
timeline: "6 to 12 weeks for a typical corporate site of 20 to 60 pages."
stack:
  - Hugo
  - Astro
  - TypeScript
  - Storyblok
  - Sanity
  - Cloudflare
benefits:
  - title: "Pages that load in under a second"
    text: "Static output, processed images and almost no client-side JavaScript. We set a performance budget in week one and fail the build when it is exceeded."
  - title: "Editing that does not need a developer"
    text: "Content models are designed around how your team actually writes, so marketing can ship a campaign page without a deployment ticket."
  - title: "Accessible by default"
    text: "Semantic markup, keyboard paths and screen reader testing during development rather than an audit at the end."
  - title: "Hosting that costs tens, not thousands"
    text: "Static sites on a CDN remove most of the operational surface. One client's hosting bill went from €1,400 to €19 a month."
process:
  - title: "Audit and content model"
    text: "We inventory the existing site, map what earns traffic and design the content model around it."
    duration: "1 week"
  - title: "Design system"
    text: "Components, typography and spacing decided once, documented, then assembled into page templates."
    duration: "2 weeks"
  - title: "Build and migrate"
    text: "Templates, integrations and content migration, with a staging URL from the first week."
    duration: "4 to 8 weeks"
  - title: "Launch and train"
    text: "DNS cutover, redirects, analytics and two training sessions for editors."
    duration: "1 week"
deliverables:
  - "Production site and repository"
  - "Documented component library"
  - "Content model and editor guide"
  - "Redirect map from the old URLs"
  - "Lighthouse and axe reports"
  - "Four weeks of post-launch support"

Most corporate websites are slow for boring reasons: an oversized stack, images
nobody optimised, and third-party scripts added one at a time over five years.
We start by measuring, then remove before we add.

The output is usually a static site generated at build time, hosted on a CDN,
with a headless CMS for editors. That combination removes servers to patch, cuts
hosting cost to near zero, and makes the site fast in the places where your
customers actually are, which is rarely a desktop on fibre.

{{< callout title="Before you commission a rebuild" >}}
Ask for a measurement of the current site from field data, segmented by device.
If nobody can produce one, the rebuild has no baseline to be judged against.
